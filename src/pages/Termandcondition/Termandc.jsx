            fees that you will be charged based on our schedule of Fees and
            Charges, which we may change from time to time and will update by
            placing on our Website. We may choose to temporarily change the fees
            for our services for promotional events (for example, discounts on
            memberships) or new services, and such changes are effective when we
            post a temporary promotional event or new service on the Websites,

            not have an existing account on 44 Resources and who join and create
            a new account, will be reduced from 10% to 0%, for all future
            Projects performed by the referring Seller ("Referrer") for the
            referred Buyer ("Referee").

            <li>
              Project commission fees for the 44 Resources only are lowered from
              10% to 0% under this promotion. All other fees and charges remain
              unaffected including but not limited to Buyer commissions and

            <strong>For Indian Seller on 44 Resources only:</strong> As of 1st
            of October 2018 Indian GST laws mandate a collection of 1% GST by 44
            Resources.com as tax on the net value of taxable supplies made by
            the Seller through the web portal of 44 Resources. Accordingly, 44
            Resources shall collect a 1% tax from the net value of the taxable
            projects or listings made by the Buyer and will deposit the same to
            the Indian government exchequer in accordance with applicable GST
            laws. In cases where (i) the Seller is outside India and (ii) GST is
            payable by the Buyer under reverse charge basis, 44 Resources is not
            required to collect this tax.

            our costs; (3) we refund funds to the User in accordance with any
            refund policy specified by us from time to time; (4) we find out
            that the original payment made by the User is fraudulent; (5) the

            cost effective manner through binding non-appearance-based

            resolution (ADR) provider, which is to be selected by you from a
            panel of ADR providers that 44 Resources will provide to you. The

            shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or
            witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and c)
            any judgement on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered
